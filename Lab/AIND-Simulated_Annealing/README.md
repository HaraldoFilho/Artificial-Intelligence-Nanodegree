### [_**Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) from Udacity

### **Exercise**

In this exercise we checked our understanding of [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) by implementing the algorithm in a Jupyter notebook and using it to solve the [Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) between US state capitals.
