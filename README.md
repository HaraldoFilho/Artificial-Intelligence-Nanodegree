- Search, Optimization and Planning
- Fundamentals of Probabilistic Graphical Models

## Projects

### Project 1: [Solve a Sudoku with AI](Projects/Project_1/AIND-Sudoku)

In this project, we had to build an intelligent agent that solves every sudoku using some AI techniques: Elimination, Only Choice, Naked Twins, Constraint Propagation and Search. It was implemented a diagonal sudoku.

### Project 2: [Build a Game-Playing Agent](Projects/Project_2/AIND-Isolation)

In this project, we had to develop an adversarial search agent to play the game Isolation using some AI techniques: Minimax Search, Depth-Limited Search, Iterative Deepening and Alpha-Beta Pruning. It was implemented a variation of the Isolation game where the players move as a horse on the chess game.

### Project 3: [Implement a Planning Search](Projects/Project_3/AIND-Planning)

In this project, we had to implement a planning search agent to solve logistics planning problems for an Air Cargo transport system using _Propositional Logic_ to define the problems in _PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language)_. The same problems were implemented using non-heuristic and heuristic methods.

### Project 4: [Build a Sign Language Recognizer](Projects/Project_4/AIND-Recognizer)

In this project, we have to build a system to recognize gestures of the American Sign Language (ASL). The goal is to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using a dataset of gestures extracted from video, identifying individual words from test sequences.

## Lab

Exercise with a topic not covered on the projects

### [Simulated Annealing](Lab/AIND-Simulated_Annealing)

In this exercise we checked our understanding of simulated annealing by implementing the algorithm in a Jupyter notebook and using it to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals.
