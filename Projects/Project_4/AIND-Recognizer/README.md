#  [Sign Language Recognition System](https://github.com/udacity/AIND-Recognizer)

### [_**Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) from Udacity

### **Project 4**

In this project, we have to build a system to recognize gestures of the [American Sign Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language) (ASL). The goal is to train a [Hidden Markov Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) (HMM) using a dataset of gestures extracted from video, identifying individual words from test sequences.
