### [_**Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) from Udacity

### **Project 3**

In this project, we had to implement a planning search agent to solve logistics planning problems for an Air Cargo transport system using Propositional Logic to define the problems in PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language). The same problems were implemented using non-heuristic and heuristic methods.

#### Topics covered
