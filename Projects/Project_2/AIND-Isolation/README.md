#  [Build a Game-Playing Agent](https://github.com/udacity/AIND-Isolation)

### [_**Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) from Udacity

### **Project 2**

In this project, we had to develop an adversarial search agent to play the game **_Isolation_** using some AI techniques: Minimax Search, Depth-Limited Search, Iterative Deepening and Alpha-Beta Pruning. It was implemented a variation of the Isolation game where the players move as a horse on the chess game.

#### Topics covered

- Minimax Algorithm
- Branching Factor
- Depth-Limited Search
- Evaluation Functions
- Quiescent Search
- Iterative Deepening
- Horizon Effect
- Alpha-Beta Pruning

#### Project Status
